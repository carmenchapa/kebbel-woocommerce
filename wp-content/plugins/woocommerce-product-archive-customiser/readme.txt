Customise the appearance of product archives in WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Allows you to customise WooCommerce product archives. Change the number of product columns and the number of products displayed per page. Toggle the display of core elements and enable some that are not included in WooCommerce core such as stock levels and product categories.

Please feel free to contribute on <a href="https://github.com/jameskoster/woocommerce-product-archive-customiser">github</a>.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `woocommerce-product-archive-customiser` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the options in the 'Product Archives' section of the WordPress Customizer.
3. Done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= One / Some of the options don't work. What gives? =

If your theme has been integrated with WooCommerce it is possibly already adding or removing some of the archive compontents. If so the plugin options may be overwritten by the theme regardless of the settings you choose.

= The categories / new badge / stock don't look very good. Help! =
It's possible you will need to add a little css to your theme / child theme to tidy up these elements.

= I want to style the "new" badge, stock notices and categories myself, how do I remove the default styles? =

There are only a couple of styles applied to these components. Although not best practise it's probably safe to just overwrite these with your own css. However, if you want to do it properly (and cut out a http request), add the following code to the functions.php file in your theme / child theme to dequeue the css:

`
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'remove_pac_styles', 30 );
function remove_pac_styles() {
	wp_dequeue_style( 'pac-styles' );
}
`
